# Blood Request Notification System - Test Guide

## What has been implemented:

### ✅ Notification Service (`lib/services/notification_service.dart`)
- Automatically finds eligible donors based on blood type
- Checks 3-month eligibility rule (90 days since last donation)
- Sends notifications only to eligible donors
- Stores notification data in Firestore

### ✅ Enhanced Blood Request Form (`lib/blood_request/blood_request_form.dart`)
- Integrated with notification service
- Shows loading dialog while processing
- Displays count of notified donors
- Stores blood request data in Firestore

### ✅ Notifications Screen (`lib/screens/notifications_screen.dart`)
- Displays all notifications for the user
- Shows unread count with badge
- Blood request notifications show detailed information
- Mark as read/delete functionality

### ✅ Enhanced Donor Dashboard (`lib/dashboard/donor_dashboard.dart`)
- Notification bell icon with unread count badge
- Real-time notification count updates
- Navigation to notifications screen

## How it works:

1. **Blood Request Submission:**
   - Hospital/Donor fills blood request form
   - System queries all donors with matching blood type
   - Checks each donor's eligibility (3 months since last donation)
   - Sends notification to eligible donors only

2. **Notification Reception:**
   - Eligible donors see notification bell with count
   - Notifications show blood type, units needed, contact info
   - Donors can respond by contacting the requester

3. **Database Structure:**
   ```
   /notifications
     - userId: (recipient donor ID)
     - title: "Blood Request - O+"
     - message: "Hospital needs 2 units of O+ blood..."
     - type: "blood_request"
     - data: {bloodType, units, contact, requiredDate, location, requester}
     - isRead: false
     - createdAt: timestamp
   
   /blood_requests
     - bloodType, units, contact, requiredDate
     - location: {latitude, longitude}
     - requesterName, requesterType
     - notifiedDonors: [array of donor IDs]
     - createdAt, status
   ```

## Testing Steps:

1. **Register donors with different blood types**
2. **Set some donors' lastDonation to simulate eligibility/ineligibility**
3. **Submit a blood request** (from hospital or donor account)
4. **Check that only eligible donors receive notifications**
5. **Verify notification bell shows correct count**
6. **Test notification detail view and response**

## Key Features:

- ✅ **Eligibility Check**: Only donors eligible to donate (3+ months since last donation) receive notifications
- ✅ **Blood Type Matching**: Notifications sent only to matching blood type donors
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Notification count updates in real-time
- ✅ **Rich Notifications**: Include all necessary details (contact, location, urgency)
- ✅ **Response System**: Donors can easily contact requesters
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: All requests and notifications stored in Firestore

The system is now fully functional and ready for testing!
