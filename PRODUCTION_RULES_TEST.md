# Production Rules Testing Checklist

After applying the production Firestore rules, test these features:

## ‚úÖ **User Authentication & Profile**
- [ ] Users can log in/register
- [ ] Users can view their own profile
- [ ] Users can edit their own profile information
- [ ] Users can view other users' basic info (name, blood type) but not sensitive data

## ‚úÖ **Notification System**
- [ ] Users can view their own notifications
- [ ] Users can mark notifications as read
- [ ] Users can delete their own notifications
- [ ] Blood request notifications are created successfully
- [ ] Users cannot read other users' notifications

## ‚úÖ **Blood Request System**
- [ ] Users can submit blood requests
- [ ] Blood requests create notifications for eligible donors
- [ ] Users can view all blood requests (for emergency situations)
- [ ] Users can only edit/delete their own blood requests

## ‚úÖ **Security Features**
- [ ] Users cannot access other users' personal data
- [ ] Users cannot read notifications meant for others
- [ ] Users cannot modify blood requests they didn't create
- [ ] All operations require authentication

## ‚úÖ **Debug Features**
- [ ] Use the debug button (üêõ) to test Firestore connectivity
- [ ] Verify that all tests pass in the Firestore test screen

## üö® **If Something Breaks**

If any feature stops working after applying production rules:

1. **Check the browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Use the debug screen** to identify which query is failing
3. **Temporarily revert** to test rules if needed:
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. **Report the specific error** for rule adjustment

## üìã **Expected Behavior**

With production rules:
- ‚úÖ **More secure**: Users can only access their own data
- ‚úÖ **Privacy protected**: Personal information is restricted
- ‚úÖ **Emergency access**: Blood requests visible to all (for emergencies)
- ‚úÖ **Notification privacy**: Users only see their own notifications
- ‚úÖ **Request ownership**: Users can only modify their own requests
